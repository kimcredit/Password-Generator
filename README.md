# Password-Generator

This application generates a random password based on the user's selected criteria. 

When the user clicks 'generate password', they are taken through a series of promts to select their passwords criteria.

The user can choose:
  1. The length of the password between 8 and 128 characters
  2. Whether the password includes uppercase letters
  3. Whether the password includes lowercase letters
  4. Whether the password includes numbers
  5. Whether the password includes special characters
  
The returned password will appear in the site's text area where it can be copied and pasted by the user.

I hope to adapt this to a form-driven selection model in a future iteration.
